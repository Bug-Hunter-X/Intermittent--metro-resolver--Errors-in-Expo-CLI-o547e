While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the 'metro-resolver' package. The specific error message varied, but it essentially prevented the app from starting. This error was intermittent and didn't always occur, making it difficult to reproduce consistently. The code itself was not throwing any errors, leading me to suspect a configuration issue or dependency conflict.
